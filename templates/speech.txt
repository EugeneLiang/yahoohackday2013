we are [team name]
The problem we want to solve is usage of Open Data ( iCulture or Taipei Government )
We want more people to use Open Data.
we think that Open Data provided by iCulture and Govt is great, and it's a pity that there isn't much usage.


our hack is Open Data meets YQL




I feel that the main reasons for limited usage is due to the lack of tools
for people to browse or use the API.


END:
using this hack, we hope that people can write code correctly and more people will use Open Data.

thanks.
